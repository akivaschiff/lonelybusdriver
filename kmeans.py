"""
This is a pure Python implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithmn. The
original can be found here:
http://pandoricweb.tumblr.com/post/8646701677/python-implementation-of-the-k-means-clustering
I have refactored the code and added comments to aid in readability.
After reading through this code you should understand clearly how K-means works.
If not, feel free to email me with questions and suggestions. (iandanforth at
gmail)
This script specifically avoids using numpy or other more obscure libraries. It
is meant to be *clear* not fast.
I have also added integration with the plot.ly plotting service. If you put in
your (free) plot.ly credentials below, it will automatically plot the discovered
clusters and their centroids.
To use plotly integration you will need to:
1. Get a username/key from www.plot.ly/api and enter them below
2. Install the plotly module: pip install plotly
